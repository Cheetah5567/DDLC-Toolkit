# DDLC-Toolkit
A toolkit for Dan Salvato's DDLC.

Chrome is required, or you can retool it for firefox, but I'm a lazy bastard.

## Cloning the repo for noobies

Use the command "git clone --recursive https://github.com/GarnetSunset/DDLC-Toolkit" when cloning please!

## Requirements

Run requirements.bat to install the modules... more will be added later but for now only six is required.

## Template

@therationalpi made a template for mods, that I've added as a submodule for this mod. Excellent work pi!

## Running it.

Setup.bat for your first time only, this will download a fresh DDLC and extract the scripts.

## Import your edits!

Put all of your edits into the "edits" folder and they will be thrown into the game folder.

Run "mergeChanges.py"!
